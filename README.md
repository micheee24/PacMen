# PacMen

## Description

This is a JavaScript code that creates and animates PacMen images on a webpage. It uses a factory function to create PacMen objects with random positions and velocities, and updates their positions using a loop and collision detection.

## How to Run

In order to execute the PacMen there are really only two steps into making it work. First is to press the “Add PacMan” as many as you wish and hit “Start Game” it will then do as described. Fun little fact of the program the more you hit the “Start Game” the faster the PacMen move across the screen. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will contain of setting a limit to how fast the PacMen can go. As well as having the faces change with direction. A more advanced improvement will be to check collision with other PacMen.
